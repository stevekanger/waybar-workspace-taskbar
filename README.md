# Waybar Workspace Taskbar

**Seems to be fairly stable but still considered alpha. Changes are likely.**

Workspace taskbar for window managers that shows only open windows from the current workspace. This differs from included wlr taskbar which shows all open windows on all workspaces. This takes advantage of the waybar cffi module [Waybar CFFI](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Module:-CFFI).

This was developed mostly due to non traditional window manager layouts like scrolling, fullscreen tabbed, or monocle where you can easily lose track of your open windows. This gives you the ability to easily visualize your open windows. Tabs will try to be sorted so they reflect the left and right cycling positions of your windows. All floating windows will be sorted to the end in the order they are received.

## Suported Window Managers

Window managers need to have the abilty for us to get the required data to display the windows. This would include an ipc or command line interface to listen to workspace and window events and fetch the required data. Then some way to be able to send commands to focus, close and toggle float on windows.

Currently supported window managers.

- Sway
- Hyprland
- Niri

## Building and Installation

You must have some required packages installed. Look to your package manager for the correct installation of each.

- make
- meson
- gtk+-3.0 version >=3.22.0
- json-glib-1.0

Then clone or dowload the repo and you can simply run

```
make
```

I'll leave the installation location up to you. You only need the `.so` file in the build folder.

```
cp build/waybar-workspace-taskbar.so /your/desired/location/
```

More than likely you would move it to ~/.config/waybar/cffi/

## Configuration

You need to setup the `cffi/module-name` in your `config.json` file for waybar. Reference [Waybar CFFI Example](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Module:-CFFI#examples).

Minimal example:

```json
"modules-left": [
    "cffi/waybar-workspace-taskbar"
],
"cffi/waybar-workspace-taskbar": {
    "module_path": "~/.config/waybar/cffi/waybar-workspace-taskbar.so",
    "window_manager": "sway"
}
```

Note: You may need to use absolute paths depending on your environment.

### Configuration Options

**IMPORTANT: Configuration inside this module does not support comments in your json**

Even though your using jsonc waybar doesn't parse out the comments when passing them to the cffi module. So as of right now keep your comments outside the cffi module config.

### Actions

The following actions are supported for `on-click`, `on-click-middle`, and `on-click-right`:

| Action           | Description                                      | Sway       | Hyprland   | Niri         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|

| `minimize-raise` | Focus if not active, minimize if active          | ⚠️ activate | ✅     | ⚠️ activate  |

⚠️ = Partial support (uses workaround)
❌ = Not supported (logs warning)

### Configuring Styles

A couple of css classes will be applied so you can style things accordingly.

- `.taskbar`
- `.taskbar.overflow-start`
- `.taskbar.overflow-end`
- `.taskbar.empty`
- `.taskbar.single`
- `.tabs`
- `.tab`
- `.tab.focused`
- `.tab.floating`
- `.tab.urgent`
- `.navigation-btn-prev`
- `.navigation-btn-next`

Simple example might be like the following:

```css
.taskbar.overflow-start .tabs {
  border-left: 10px solid red;
}

.taskbar.overflow-end .tabs {
  border-right: 10px solid red;
}

.tab {
  color: white;
  padding: 5px 10px;
}

.tab.focused {
  background: blue;
}

.tab.floating {
  color: green;
}

.tab.urgent {
  color: red;
}
```

The css parent/child structure is as follows:

```jsx
<Taskbar>
  <NavigationBtnPrev />
  <Tabs>
    <Tab />
    <Tab />
    <Tab />
  </Tabs>
  <NavigationBtnNext />
</Taskbar>
```

## Usage

Click actions are configurable via `on-click`, `on-click-middle`, and `on-click-right` options.

Defaults:

- Left Click: Activate (focus) Window
- Middle Click: Toggle Float
- Right Click: Close Window

## Known issues

Hyprland

- Hyprctl doesn't expose urgent status when fetching window information.
- Hyprland doesn't send an event when toggling floating windows. So window status and sorting will not be updated until you change focus.
